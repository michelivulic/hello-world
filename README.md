# "Hello World!"
## My learning path diary

Hi! My name is Michel. At first I wrote this README as part of the GitHub tutorial, but now I use it as a place to keep track of my learning path. 

I started programming in Q4 2017. I wanted to learn something new and, since I knew nothing about development, it seemed interesting. I wondered how technology could advance when the languages and their rules are created by us. I soon discovered that we build the building blocks (heh), but like with Legos, the possibilities are endless. 

This revelation hooked me and I picked up a book (Learn Python the Hard Way) started following a couple of online computer science courses. In no-time I was messing around in the command line and writing text-based, choice-driven story terminal games. 

Having fun with my newfound hobby, I enrolled in a data analysis course at my university. Here my skills and creativity were really tested when we had to solve a complex problem in a team during a ten-week project. At this point I knew I wanted to seriously continue down this path. 

I started sending my resume to a variety of companies to try and find a data analysis internship and I was lucky enough to get one. During a five-month internship I pushed myself to learn every day about Python, modules such as pandas and matplotlib, Jupyter, git, etc. I knew I was years behind compared to actual CompSci students, but I had fun learning. And I learned a lot. 

Next week I will be starting a thesis project involving an even more complex problem. I'm super excited to keep on learning. 

They're small steps at a time, but I'm making sure I keep exploring the wonderful world of programming.
